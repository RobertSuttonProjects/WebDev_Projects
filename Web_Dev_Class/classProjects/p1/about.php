        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Cora Kay-Care! I’m Cora, and I’m so excited to welcome your family. As a paraprofessional at Canton
            Pre-School, I’ve spent years helping kids learn and grow, and I bring that same passion for care and
            development here. I believe that every child deserves a place where they can feel safe, supported, and happy.
            When I’m not working with kids, you can find me tending to my plants, playing pickleball, or cheering on the
            Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Blues. I look forward to getting to know your child and helping them thrive!
        </p>

            At Cora Kay-Care, our vision is to create a safe, nurturing, and fun environment where young children can grow,

            individual development. Our goal is to foster curiosity, creativity, and a love for learning, while also
            providing a secure and caring space for your child. We are committed to helping children build a strong
            foundation for lifelong success, while ensuring parents feel confident and supported in their choice of care.
