            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Cora Kay-Care! I’m Cora, and I’m so excited to welcome your family. As a paraprofessional at Canton
                Pre-School, I’ve spent years helping kids learn and grow, and I bring that same passion for care and
                development here. I believe that every child deserves a place where they can feel safe, supported, and happy.
                When I’m not working with kids, you can find me tending to my plants, playing pickleball, or cheering on the
                Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Blues. I look forward to getting to know your child and helping them thrive!</p>

            <p>At Cora Kay-Care, our vision is to create a safe, nurturing, and fun environment where young children can grow,
                learn, and thrive. We believe that every child is unique and deserves personalized attention that supports their
                individual development. Our goal is to foster curiosity, creativity, and a love for learning, while also
                providing a secure and caring space for your child. We are committed to helping children build a strong
                foundation for lifelong success, while ensuring parents feel confident and supported in their choice of care.
