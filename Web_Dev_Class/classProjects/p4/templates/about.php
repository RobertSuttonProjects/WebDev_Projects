            Hey there! Welcome to My Game Backlog! My name is Robert Sutton,
            and I created this site in November of 2024 for my Web Development class
            during my junior year at Quincy University. This site is all
            about helping people like me keep track of their game collections.
            Whether it’s a game you’re playing, one you want to play, or one
            you’ve already beaten, this site makes it easy to stay organized.

            I built this site using a mix of web development tools.
            The backend is powered by PHP, which connects
            everything to a database where all the game info and user
            profiles are stored.For the frontend, I used HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript to make the site look good and work smoothly.
            I also added AJAX to let the site update without having to
            reload the page, which makes everything feel clean and easy to use.
